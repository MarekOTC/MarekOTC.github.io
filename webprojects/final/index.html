                    <h5>What is Forensic Accounting?</h5>
                    <p>The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners estimates that organizations lose at least
                        5% of
                        their revenues to fraud each year. So, if your business is bringing in $1 million in
                        annual
                        revenues, you could be losing $50,000 of those hard-earned dollars to occupational fraud
                        – fraud
                        committed by employees against their employers. All fraud is committed by a person in a
                        position
                        of trust.</p>
                    <h5>What is Tax Resolution?</h5>
                    <p>For most people, dealing with the IRS isn’t fun or easy. And when you get audited, it
                        can be
                        overwhelming. You DON’T want to deal with your tax situation yourself… but you don’t
                        want to pay
                        high rates for someone else to handle it either! We’ve got you covered – we’re a
                        local company
                        that provides personalized tax resolution service at a fraction of the cost of those
                        large
                        national tax firms. Our team has decades of experience helping taxpayers just like
                        you resolve
                        their issues quickly and easily!</p>

                    <h5>Parable of the Lost Coin</h5>
                    <p>8 “Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Doesn’t she light a lamp, sweep the
                        house and search carefully until she finds it? 9 And when she finds it, she calls her friends
                        and
                        neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me; I have found my lost coin.’ 10 In the same way, I
                        tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”
